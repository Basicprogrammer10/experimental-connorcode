        including songs like her “Can I Get a Bump?” After that, Ayesha released
        her two albums (Big Juicy and Barely Legal) and her one EP (Cumshot) in
        2016 with various songs. It was released in October but was eventually

        Work on Ayesha’s new third album Fresh Meat began in late 2016, shortly
        after Gangbang was canceled. In April 2017, Ayesha released the album
        titled His track on her SoundCloud page. A new single, Literal Legend,
        was released in the fall of that year, with promises of a music video
        for the song coming out in the coming weeks. , and will be available for
        streaming on iTunes and for purchase as a physical CD, but this never
        happened. After the release of her EP http://www.FuckMe.com in November
        2017, fans speculated that the tracks on the EP were originally for a
        shelved album.

        In 2018, Ayesha announced that she was working on another third studio
        album, horny.4u. The album was published on Ayesha’s Instagram, with the
        back cover and tracklist revealed around July 16, 2018, containing eight
        standard tracks and some “MySpace exclusive bonus tracks”. . On August
        28, 2018, she released a complete version of her Control previously
        released in demo form on her SoundCloud account in early 2016, including
        a newly released bonus her track, Alluded to her five confirmed tracks
        on the album. A little later, Ayesha took to her Twitter to clear up any
        misunderstandings regarding the album and her career direction,
        announcing her two versions of the album and project due in December
        2018 (Spotify and her iTunes standard). 8-track version) has been
        officially confirmed for release. And an ‘xxxtra dirty’ deluxe version
        with 6 bonus tracks of hers is planned for SoundCloud. Around the same

        that the album would be a break from her music.

        In late 2018, user void4ngel published the master post for all of
        Ayesha’s previously unknown social media accounts. He had also posted
        her real name, Ayesha Alexis Auciello, which he found via another
        unknown public personal account, on her doxx bin. It was his intention
        for her to enable her dox, but that didn’t happen.

        Upon seeing this post, Ayesha falsely accused Quinn of being her Fatale
        and, in retaliation, exposed Quinn and his entire family. This includes
        his parents, grandparents, cousins ​​, and siblings. Quinn then leaks a
        demo of Ayesha’s music in revenge. All of this ultimately led to
        Horny.4u’s dismissal and eventually her retirement. Ayesha announced her
        retirement in late 2018, stating that she would no longer release music
        under the alias Ayesha Erotica, but would continue working as a producer
        and songwriter for others as a source of income.

        At one point, Ayesha surprised fans with a soon-deleted Instagram story
        claiming new music was coming, which never materialized. On February 11,
        2019, Ayesha hinted on her Instagram that the release of horny.4u’s
        long-awaited bonus track, Delicious, would be the official final single
        of her career, but it was never released. bottom. In July 2019,
        collaborators Petey Plastic and That Kid posted a selfie with Ayesha on
        Twitter, sparking rumors that she was out of retirement and a
        long-awaited comeback might be in the works. This was later debunked by
        Ayesha herself when she posted on her Instagram story that she would
        never return to music and that the theories surrounding it were false.
