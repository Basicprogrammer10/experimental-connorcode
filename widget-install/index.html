          Welcome to my quickly thrown together widget install guide!
          <br /><br />

          To start, go to
          <a href="https://widget.connotcode.com">widget.connotcode.com</a>.
          Then click "Sign Up" or "Log In". Also now might be a good time to
          mention this only works on iOS. (Scroll down to continue)
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/3.PNG" />
        <p>
          Put in your school email (name@bernardsboe.com), click next and put in
          your genesis password. This is your 6 digit student ID number or an
          actual password if you set one.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>The widget</em> logs you in to genesis with your credentials to
          get your schedule. So if you ever change your password, you may need
          to log in again to update it. Don't worry about me seeing your
          password or anything, I could see that without you using the widget if
          I wanted to (but i dont).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/4.PNG" />
        <p>
          If all goes well, you should now be on your account page. You will now
          need to download the
          <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188"
            >Scriptable</a
          >
          app. This app allows you to write code that runs on your phone and Its
          what I originally used to make this widget a few years ago on my first
          day of high school.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/6.PNG" />
        <p>
          Now click to download the widget script. Just so you know, the script
          is customized for you with your account ID. This means that if anyone
          else gets it, they will be able to see your schedule. Which could be a
          good thing i guess.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/8.PNG" />
        <p>
          Now that its downloaded, open the downloads page in Safari. (Or
          whatever web browser you use).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/9.PNG" />
        <p>Click on the script.</p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/10.PNG" />
        <p>Ignore all the scarry text and click the share button.</p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/11.PNG" />
        <p>
          Now click the scriptable app. (You might have to scroll down to find
          the app).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/12.PNG" />
        <p>
          Now that its opened in the scriptable app, click "Add to my scripts".
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/13.PNG" />
        <p>
          You can now click the little play button in the bottom right corner to
          make sure everything is working.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/14.PNG" />
        <p>
          If it is, you should see your schedule. (Because we go to all of our
          classes on the first day the text is kinda overflowing outside of the
          widget, but this wont be a problem for most of the year.)
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/15.PNG" />
        <p>
          Now you can add the widget to your widget panel thing. (I like this
          because you can access it without unlocking your phone). Anyway, click
          "Edit" then the "+" button.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/18.PNG" />
        <p>Select the Scriptable widget.</p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/19.PNG" />
        <p>Choose how big you want it. I would recommend the middle size.</p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/20.PNG" />
        <p>Add the widget and tap on it to open its configuration.</p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/21.PNG" />
        <p>Click "Choose" to select the script to run for the widget.</p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/22.PNG" />
        <p>Select the "Classes" script and close the menu.</p>
      </div>
      <div step>
        <img screenshot src="./images/25.PNG" />
        <p>
          And thats all! If it ever stops working for some time (like a few
          days) feel free to reach out, genesis may have changed how they
          display the schedule, which should be pretty easy to fix and you wont
          even have to update the script or anything.
          <br /><br />
          You can configure the background gradient and text color if you would
          really like. I wont go into depth here but you have to edit the script
          in Scriptable and change the values under "// User config".
